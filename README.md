This study employs a novel integrated approach whereby we combine receptor-based source apportionment with conditional logistic regression models for the first time. This approach enabled us to comprehensively examine the association between source-specific PM2.5-bound species and cardiorespiratory disease hospital admissions in Joinville, a coastal industrial city in Brazil.
